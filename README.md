# Discordify

Adds a new context menu option for the following file types:

.mp4
.webm
.mkv

These videos can now be compressed to 25mb (the Discord size limit) by just right-clicking them and clicking 'Discordify'.

Requires admin privileges to install and uninstall, as registry changes are made to modify the Explorer context menu.

Files are installed in: 
%AppData%\Discordify

## Install ffmpeg
